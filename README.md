# DrumNickyDrum Sequencer

## Dev notes

Naming is important. Trying to avoid collisions and confusion such as:

- `play()` ... is this play sequence or play sample?
- sequence vs pattern ?

### Current solution:

- `start()` sequence
- `trigger()` sample/note
- working towards the following sequence structure:

```
sequence: {
    bpm: number,
    instrument: {
        sample1: {
            sampler: Tone.Sampler,
            key: <event code>,
        },
        sample2: ...,
        sample3: ...,
        sample4: ...,
    },
    pattern: [
        // array of which samples to trigger
        // at each step of the sequence
        {
            instrument[sample1]: [vol, tune, length],
            instrument[sample2]: [vol, tune, length],
            instrument[sample3]: [vol, tune, length],
            instrument[sample4]: [vol, tune, length],
        },
        {},{},{}...
    ],
}
```
