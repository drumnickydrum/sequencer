# DrumNickyDrum Sequencer

## Dev notes

### 2/12/2021

- Still playing around with data structure. Instrument and pattern are currently an array to work with ease of 0-based indexing.
- Memoized Cell and SoundCell for as few re-paints as possible. It was repainting 576 divs every time the selected sound was changed (64 cells x 9 sound-cells). Now it only repaints the cells that are affected.
  - result is ~1-10% of previous re-paints:
    - 64 cells re-paint on selected sound change.
    - 1 sound-cell re-paints on cell click.
  - cost of memo comparison not figured into this. Can't be certain this is a gain or a loss just yet.

## Structure

Naming is important. Trying to avoid collisions and confusion such as:

- `play()` ... is this play sequence or play sample?
- sequence vs pattern ?

### Current solution:

- `start()` sequence
- `trigger()` sample/note
- 'instrument' is a collection of 'samples' (or in the future oscillators, etc...)
- working towards the following sequence structure:

```
sequence: {
    bpm: number,
    instrument: {
        sample1: {
            sampler: Tone.Sampler,
            key: <event code>,
        },
        sample2: ...,
        sample3: ...,
        sample4: ...,
    },
    pattern: [
        // array of which samples to trigger
        // at each step of the sequence
        {
            instrument[sample1]: [vol, tune, length],
            instrument[sample2]: [vol, tune, length],
            instrument[sample3]: [vol, tune, length],
            instrument[sample4]: [vol, tune, length],
        },
        {},{},{}...
    ],
}
```
